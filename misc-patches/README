Here you will find patches against Gutenprint that enables multicut support
for every model that I'm aware of.

This code is not mainlined, and isn't likely to be in its current state.

If you are going to patch gutenprint and compile it yourself, I highly 
recommend using the latest code out of CVS, available here:
