There are three sets of files here:

 *.lut -- Color Lookup tables
 *.raw -- Matte lamination data
 *.h   -- Data tables derived from *.cpc

All files were directly copied or derived from the 'cpc' files bundled 
with the Windows drivers of the various members of the Mitsubishi CP-D70 
family.  The header files were generated using the perl script here.
