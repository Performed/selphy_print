   ** ** ** ** Do NOT contact Sinfonia about this library! ** ** ** **

   This is intended to be a drop-in replacement for Sinfonia's proprietary
   libS6145ImageProcess library, which is necessary in order to utilize
   their CHC-S6145 printer family.

   Sinfonia Inc was not involved in the creation of this library, and
   is not responsible in any way for the library or any deficiencies in
   its output.  They will provide no support if it is used.

   If you have the appropriate permission fron Sinfonia, we recommend
   you use their official libS6145ImageProcess library instead, as it
   will generate the highest quality output. However, it is only
   available for x86/x86_64 targets on Linux. Please contact your local
   Sinfonia distributor to obtain the official library.

   This library is released under the GNU GPL version 3.  Unfortunately
   this means that it cannot be bundled with Gutenprint.

   In order to utilize this library with Gutenprint, you will need:

	* Gutenprint 5.2.11
	* Current selphy_print backend
	* This library

   Gutenprint 5.2.12-pre and newer already include up-to-date backend
   code, so you will only need to compile and install this library.

   To build this library:

	make
	make install
