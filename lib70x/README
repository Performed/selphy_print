                                the Mitsubishi CP-D70 family of printers

   ** ** ** ** Do NOT contact Mitsubishi about this library! ** ** ** **

   This library is a platform-independent reimplementation of the image
   processing algorithms that are necessary to utilize the Mitsubishi
   CP-D70 family of printers.

   Mitsubishi was *NOT* involved in the creation of this library, and is
   not responsible in any way for the library or any deficiencies in its
   output.  They will provide no support if it is used.

   However, without this library, it is nearly impossible to utilize the
   D70 family of printers under Linux and similar operating systems.

   The following printers are known (or expected) to function with this
   library:

     * Mitsubishi CP-D70DW
     * Mitsubishi CP-D707DW
     * Mitsubishi CP-K60DW-S
     * Mitsubishi CP-D80DW
     * Kodak 305
     * Fuji ASK-300

   This library is released under the GNU GPL version 3.  Unfortunately
   this means that it cannot be bundled with Gutenprint.

   In order to utilize this library with Gutenprint, you will need:

	* Gutenprint 5.2.12-pre4 or newer
	* Current selphy_print backend
	* This library

   To build this library:

	make
	make install
