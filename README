 ***************************************************************************

  This intelligent backend is needed to utilize many common dye-sublimation
  photo printers under Linux, OSX, and other UNIX-like operating systems.

  Although these printers advertise themselves as standard USB Printer Class
  devices, they do not actually obey those specifications and require
  special two-way handshaking in order to successfully print.

  This backend can only be used in conjunction with Gutenprint 5.2.10 or
  newer. Please see the Gutenprint README file (section II D) for more
  information on use of this backend and integration into CUPS.

  While this repository is considered the canonical upstream source for
  this code, code snapshots are bundled with each Gutenprint release.
  Generally speaking, the code in this repository will require the current
  Gutenprint release (or pre-release) to generate the actual print jobs.

  As such, when compared to any given Gutenprint release, the code found
  here is usually newer, with additional features, device support, and
  bugfixes.  At the same time, it may have half-developed features that
  don't quite work, with giant bugs that come out at midnight to eat
  your cat.

  With rare exceptions, all printer support in selphy_print (and Gutenprint)
  was developed without any assistance from the printer manufactuers,
  relying on reverse-engineering and a great deal of experimentation.

  On that note, please keep in mind that this software distributed
  in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.

 ***************************************************************************

  This backend also supports a "standalone" mode that performs various
  utility functions for selected printers, such as querying status and
  configuring various parameters. The exact commands supported for each
  printer are documented below.

 ***************************************************************************
  Compilation:

     This tool requires libusb 1.0 to build.  We highly recommend
     v1.0.16 or newer due to general stability improvements. Versions
     older than 1.0.10 will require -DLIBUSB_PRE_1_0_10 to be defined
     (see the Makefile).

     To further complicate things, libusb-1.0 had a temporary fork called
     libusbx, but that was merged back into libusb as of v1.0.18.
     Consequently, your distribution package for libusb-1.0 may be
     called libusbx instead.

     Additionally, you will need the CUPS development packages installed,
     so we can figure out how the local CUPS instance is configured.

     Fedora/RedHat:
	yum install libusbx-devel libusb1-devel cups-devel
     Debian/Ubuntu
	apt-get install libusbx-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libcups2-dev

   And all you need to do after that is type 'make'

 ***************************************************************************
  CUPS backend usage:

   DEVICE_URI=someuri \
       gutenprint52+usb job-id user title num-copies options [ filename ]

    The backend generates output for CUPS to parse, including logging
    print counts, and if the printer supports it, reporting media type and
    remaining media counts.

    Please note that this backend merely handles the low-level
    communication with the printer!  Actually generating print jobs requires
    use of Gutenprint compile with support for CUPS.

   DEVICE_URI=someuri FINAL_CONTENT_TYPE=application/vnd.cups-command \
       gutenprint52+usb job-id user title num-copies options [ filename ]

    This parses a CUPS command file and performs actions listed in the file.

     Implemented commands:

       ReportLevels        Report the marker (ie media) type and levels.

     Other commands may be implemented in the future.  Individual printers
     may not implement these commands.

***************************************************************************
  Standalone usage:

    This backend is set up as a multi-call executable; that is to say
    behaivor changes based on the name used to invoke the executable.
    When compiled, a set of symlinks are created, corresponding to each
    of the internal backends.  Alternatively you may set the BACKEND
    environment variable to force a specific backend to be used.  These
    commands are equivalent:

         BACKEND=backend gutenprint52+usb [ arguments ]
	 backend [ arguments ]

     All backends support the following invocations:

        backend [ arguments ]
	backend [ arguments ] filename
	backend [ arguments ] - < filename
	somecommand | backend [ arguments ] -

      The 'filename' here refers to the raw spool data generated by
      Gutenprint (eg via its gimp plugin) or the Windows print-to-file
      output.

      All global arguments:

	   -D                 Increment debug level                      [1]
	   -G                 Display GPL text
	   -f                 Enable fast return mode if possible        [2]
	   -d numcopies       Print 'numcopies' of the supplied job

       [1]  This argument can be repeated to increase the debug level.
            Alternatively, the 'DYESUB_DEBUG' environment variable can be
	    used.  For example, '-DDD' and 'DYESUB_DEBUG=3' are equivalent.

		DYESUB_DEBUG=1		Enable debug output
		DYESUB_DEBUG=2		Dump contents of short messges
		DYESUB_DEBUG=3		Dump contents of all messages

       [2]  This terminates the backend as soon as the printer has
	    acknowledged the print job, without waiting for the print job
	    to complete.  Not all printers support this feature. This
	    can also be enabled by setting the 'FAST_RETURN' environment
	    variable.  This is the default behavior when using this backend
	    with CUPS.

      Finally, some backends support additional arguments; see their details
      below.

 ***************************************************************************
  Other Environment Variables:

      If you have multiple models of the same printer family connected
      simultaneously, the backend will choose the first one it finds.
      If you wish to target a specific device, you may specify its
      serial number using the 'SERIAL' environment variable. For example:

            SERIAL=N782 backend filename [ arguments ]

       All backends support an additional operational mode, to test out
       unknown models. To use this mode, specify the VID, PID and its
       internal device type as environment variables:

            EXTRA_VID=04a9 EXTRA_PID=3ab1 EXTRA_TYPE=7 backend filename

       The VID and PID are specified in hexidecimal, and the TYPE is
       the P_XXX enumeration defined in backend_common.h. The '7' in this
       example corresponds to most Canon SELPHY CP models, and is what you
       would use if you were trying to get the backend to detect an
       otherwise unrecognized SELPHY CP model.

       If you are able to successfuly print using this technique,
       please let us know so we can add the apppriate entry to the
       internal database.

       For debugging USB operation, there following environment variables
       can be set:

           MAX_XFER_SIZE     Maximum transfer size, in bytes.
	   XFER_TIMEOUT      Timeout, in milliseconds, for all USB operations

         for example:

           MAX_XFER_SIZE=32768 XFER_TIMEOUT=30000 backend filename

   *** VERY IMPORTANT ***

     In order to generate usable output, the Sinfonia CHC-S6145 printer
     (and its siblings) require the input data to be transformed using
     specific image processing algorithms.

     The library that implements this processing is dynamically loaded
     at runtime. There are three options:

       * libS6145ImageProcess -- Supported by Sinfonia, this is a proprietary
         library only available for x86 and x86_64 linux targets. It can be
	 obtained by politely contacting your local Sinfonia distributor.

         If you have the appropriate permission fron Sinfonia and its
	 technical and legal limitations are acceptible to you, we recommend
         you use the supported libS6145ImageProcess library, as it will
	 generate the highest quality output.

       * libS6145ImageReProcess -- GPL'd re-implementation of the Sinfonia
         algorithms, available as source.  It is a drop-in replacement
	 that appears to generate identical output to the proprietary
	 Sinfonia library.

	 DISCLAIMER: Sinfonia Inc was not involved in the creation of
	 libS6145ImageReProcess and is not responsible in any way for any
	 deficiencies in its output. They will provide no support if it is
	 used.

         Do *NOT* contact Sinfonia for support if you are using
	 libS6146ImageReProcess.

	    (Please see the full disclaimer in libS6145ImageReProcess.c)

       * If neither of the above libraries are found, the backend will
         fall back to a very crude algorithm that generates low-quality
	 results not suitable for photographic output

     As selphy_print is released under the terms of the GPL, it cannot
     normally be combined with proprietary libraries.

     Therefore, the authors of selphy_print grant its users an additional
     permission (under section 7 of the GPLv3) to combine and/or redistribute
     it with the libS6145ImageProcess library.  For the full text of this
     license exception, please see the header of backend_shinkos6145.c

	the input data to be transformed using specific image processing
	algorithms.

	The library that implements this processing is dynamically loaded
	at runtime.  There is currently only one option:

	 * libMitsuD70ImageReProcess -- GPL'd re-implementation of the
	   Mitsubishi algorithms, available as source.  No guaranteees are
	   made about its output quality as compared to Mitsubishi's
	   proprietary drivers, but it is generally considered quite good.

	   DISCLAIMER:  Mitsubishi was not involved in the creation of
	   libMitsuD70ImageReProcess and is not responsible in any way for
	   any deficiencies in its output.  They will provide no support if
	   it is used.

	   Do *NOT* contact Mitsubishi for support if you are using
	   any combination of gutenprint, selphy_print or
	   libMitsuD70ImageReProcess.

             (Please see the full disclaimer in libMitsuD70ImageReProcess.c)

	 * If the above library is not found, the backend will fall back to
	   a very crude algorithm that generates low-quality results not
	   suitable for photographic output.

   Valid commands:

     -j			Query Job status
     -k num		Specify standby delay (1-60 minutes, 0 disables)
     -s                 Query printer status
     -w                 Wake up printer
     -W                 Wake up printer (and wait)
     -x num             Set USB iSerialNumber reporting (1 yes, 0 no) [1]
     -X id              Cancel print job 'id' [2]

    [1]  Printer will need to be power-cycled for this to take effect.
    [2]  Job ID is the Internal Job ID (reported via job status query)

   Supported and tested printers:

    Mitsubishi CP-D90DW

   Please note:  The CP-D90DW printer does not export a serial number
   by default.  This means that only one of these can be plugged into
   the same system.  If you wish to use more than one of these
   simultaneously, you must enable the 'iSerial' mode by using the '-x'
   command as described below.

   Valid commands:

     -i                 Query printer information
     -j jobid           Query job status [1]
     -k num		Specify standby delay (1-255 minutes, 0 disables)
     -m                 Query printer media
     -s                 Query printer status
     -x num             Set USB iSerialNumber reporting (1 yes, 0 no) [2]

  Notes:

    [1]  **** VERY IMPORTANT ****

    The CP-98xx family is similar to the CP-D70 family in that it requires
    the input data to be gamma corrected (and likely transformed in other
    ways) before it is sent to the printer.

    Unlike the D70 family, the data tables used are embedded into the driver
    instead of being bundled separately, further complicating the process
    of figuring out how everything works.  Some progress has been made,
    allowing for proper gamma correction/linearization to at least generate
    usable prints, although the quality is not considered up to par.
