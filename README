  Known Supported Printers:

   Canon SELPHY ES series
   Canon SELPHY CP series
   Kodak Professional 1400
   Kodak 605 Photo Printer
   Kodak 805 Photo Printer

 ***************************************************************************
  Compilation:

     You will need libusbx to build this tool.

     Fedora/RedHat:
	yum install libusbx-devel
     Debian/Ubuntu
	apt-get install libusbx-dev

   And all you need to do after that is type 'make'

 ***************************************************************************
  CUPS backend usage:

   The simple method is to use Gutenprint 5.2.10 or newer, which bundles 
   (possibly older versions of) this backend.  Without Gutenprint to
   rasterize the print data, this backend is useless.

   The backend is called 'gutenprint+usb', and must be installed with 0700
   file permissions and owned by root in order to function properly.

   To install this backend for use with CUPS, simply type 'make install'.

   You may need to restart CUPS afterwards.

   DEVICE_URI=someuri \
       gutenprint+usb job-id user title num-copies options [ filename ]

 ***************************************************************************
  Standalone usage:

    This backend is set up as a multi-call executable; that is to say
    behaivor changes based on the name used to invoke the executable.
    When compiled, a set of symlinks are created, corresponding to each
    of the internal backends.  Alternatively you may set the BACKEND
    environment variable to force a specific backend to be used:

        BACKEND=backend \
    	  gutenprint [ args ]

      (OR)
 
	backend [ args ]

     That said, all internal backends support these invocation options

  	backend filename
	backend - < filename
	somecommand | backend -
        backend [ backend-specific-argument ]

      The 'filename' here refers to the raw spool data generated by
      Gutenprint (eg via its gimp plugin) or the Windows print-to-file 
      output.

      If there is more than one device present that the backend handles,
      the backend will choose the first supported device it finds. If you
      wish to specify the specific device when operating in standalone 
      mode, set the 'DEVICE' environment variable to the target device's
      serial number. For example:

  	  DEVICE=N782 backend filename

      All backends support an additional operational mode, to test out
      unknown models. To use this mode, specify the VID, PID and its 
      type as environment variables. For example:

 	  EXTRA_VID=04a9 EXTRA_PID=3ab1 EXTRA_TYPE=3 backend filename

	EXTRA_VID is the USB VID, in hex
	EXTRA_PID is the USB PID, in hex
	EXTRA_TYPE is:	3 for SELPHY CP790
		   	4 for SELPHY CP520 (or other CP-series model)

      If you have a model the spooler doesn't recognize but it works with
      a VID/PID/TYPE specification, please let me know via e-mail.

      Finally, some backends may support additional arguments; see below:

 *************************************************************************** 
  BACKEND=shinkos2145

   Verified supported printers:

     Shinko/Sinfonia CHC-S2145 (aka "S2")

   Development was sponsored by:

        LiveLink Technology [ www.livelinktechnology.net ]

   In order to use this backend, you will need to ensure the printer is
   configured to use the 'DRV' (as opposed to 'DLL') operating mode.  See 
   the printer documentation for details on how to set this.

   This backend supports additional commands:

      shinkos2145 [command [arg] ]

   Valid commands:

     -qs                Query printer status
     -qm		Query media information
     -qf		Query firmware version
     -qe		Query Error log
     -qu		Query User String
     -qtu filename	Query User tone curve (stored in flash)  [2]
     -qtc filename	Query Current tone curve (stored in RAM) [2]
     -su  somestring    Set User String to 'somestring'
     -stu filename      Set User tone curve (stored in flash)    [2]
     -stc filename      Set Current tone curve (stored in RAM)   [2]
     -pc  id            Cancel print job 'id'                    [1]
     -fl  		Flash printer LEDs for five seconds.
     -ru		Reset User tone curve to default         [3]
     -rp		Reset printer to factory defaults
     -b1		Enable printer control panel buttons
     -b0		Disable printer control panel buttons
     -f 		Enable fast return                       [4]

  Notes:

    [1]  Job ID is the Internal Job ID (reported via status)
    	   This cancels a multi-copy print job.
	   To see which jobs are active/pending, see the output of the
	   '-qs' command, specifically the 'Bank' output.

    [2]  Format of curvedata file:

	 256 entries each of Yellow, Magenta, Cyan mappings:
	 Values are unsigned 16-bit big endian, between 0 and 2047 
	 (ie only 11 bits used)

    [3]  Default printer tone curve is a linear 'val << 3'

    [4]  This terminates the backend as soon as the printer has acknowledged
         the print job, without waiting for the print job to complete.
         This can also be enabled by setting the 'FAST_RETURN' environment
         variable.
